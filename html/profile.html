          Mario is the main character and titular protagonist of the
          long-running and highly successful Super Mario franchise. He was
          created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and serves as
          the main mascot of Nintendo. Mario made his first appearance as the
          protagonist of the arcade game Donkey Kong, released in 1981 (in which
          he took the alias "Jumpman"). Since Super Mario Bros., his trademark
          abilities have been his jumping and stomping powers, with which he
          defeats most of his enemies, and his ability to gain even more powers
          with a plethora of items, such as the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower,
          and the Super Star. Games have usually portrayed Mario as a silent,
          straightforward character. According to Nintendo's philosophy, this
          allows Mario to fit in many different genres and roles. In most games,
          he is the hero that goes on an adventure to save Princess Peach from
          his arch-nemesis, Bowser, but he has been shown doing many other
          activities besides adventuring, such as racing and sporting with his
          younger but taller twin brother, Luigi; his friends such as Yoshi and
          Toad; and others. The above text is from the Super Mario Wiki and is
